## What are Scripties?

Scripties are High Performance GUI equivalents of Console Scripts, that are Reliable and Easy to Make. 

Categories :

- Built-In Scripties - Made in XAML & C# and Compiled. ( Static )
- User Made Scripties - Made in JSON and loaded by my Interpereter `Dynamo`. ( Dynamic )

---

## A Temporary Halt on Development :

- I wouldn't provide updates for the next couple of months.
- Issues will be addressed  and Pull Requests may be merged a bit late.
- All of this is because WinUI 3 is annoying and in return, no appreciation.
- v11.28000.17.0's Scientific Calc is VERY Confusing to make and will take Time & Experience ( in Math ). 
- I am not Maintaining this Project for a Wall, I am maintaining this as an example of What UI can be.
 
---

## Features :

- Simple and Clean GUI. ✅
- Dozens of calculation options. ✅
- Programmable using JSON-based Logic. ✅
- Fast and Error-Proof Calculations. ✅
- High Precision for decimals. ✅
- Modern UI with Fluid Animations and Transitions. ✅
- History Support for the Base Calculator UI. ✅
- Theme switching built in. ✅
- Backdrop switching betwwen Mica Alt, Mica and Acrylic! ✅
- Eggcelent Looking Splash Screen that can be toggled OFF. ✅
- Available in both Msix & Installer Variants. ✅

---

## Anti-Features :

- Slow Updates ❌
- Use of AI Assistance as I am learning UI and WinUI 3 with AI. ❌
- Lack of Scientific Calculator ( Will be Fixed ) ❌
- Use of `Alex Brush` in Branding which may look like Alien Language for certain People. ❌
- BUGS may Slip in because AI is Stupid, and without a Manual Audit, it's basically `AI SLOP`. ❌

## DETAILS ON DYNAMO :

Dynamo Scriptie Loader (DSL) is an `Interpreter` for `JSON` Code for creating a Dynamic UI for User-Made Math. 

Features :

- Dynamically Generates a UI with the Required Fields and Formulae Entered by the User.
- ONE PAGE, MULTIPLE POSSIBILITIES. Yes, `DyNamoPage.xaml` is the Backbone of Any Scriptie Mod.
- Integrated Manager `DyNamoManagerPage.xaml` that Interprets the Mods and feeds this data into `DyNamoPage.xaml` to Load the UI.
- <details> <summary><b>Very Clean & Simple Structure</b></summary>
        
        {
          "Metadata": {
            "Name": "", // This is What your Module Shows Up!
            "Author": "", // Write your Username.
            "Version": "", // This is the Version of your Scriptie.

- Thus, a `Massive Time Saver` and `Low Barrier to Entry` as one can make modules in Notepad.
- Since NCalc is NCalc and not a Compiler, the Risk of Malicious Mods is VERY LOW.

Steps to Use Dynamo Scriptie Loader:

- Go to [Lamina ✦ Modules Repo](https://github.com/Chill-Astro/Lamina-Modules-Repo).
- Download your Desired Mod, a `.lamina` File.
- Go to Menu > Press `+ Add` and Add the File from the Popup!

## Adding Currency Convertor :

Lamina ✦ uses [ExchangeRate-API](https://app.exchangerate-api.com) for Currency conversion. An API key must be manually added in the region indicated.

- Add `appsettings.json` under Lamina/ : Paste the Code into here.

        {
          "LocalSettingsOptions": {
            "ApplicationDataFolder": "Calculator/ApplicationData",
            "LocalSettingsFile": "LocalSettings.json"
          },
          "CurrencyApiKey": "Enter API Key Here"
        }

- Buid and Run the Application as shown above.

## Art 

Since Lamina ✦ is Personified as `"She"` ( Because Computers are She ) and has many Anti-Corporate Design Choices,

so here's her Fictional Human Form! ヾ(^▽^*)))
